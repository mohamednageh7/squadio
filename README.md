## Used Packages

For this project I used "react-apexcharts" because
- it provied a lot of other charts that I can use, so I can depend on it 
  for the rest of the projects needs
- it used by many developers and it's newly updated 
- it is build to support react 
- it provied a lot of features that improve the user experience

## Notice

I had to create a simple backend server because the Yahoo finance api was giving a cors error.
I searched for the reason and found it not acceptable to call from the frontend.
It needs to be called from the server.

I have also used the dates you provided in the example url as default so that you can see live data because not all the time ranges have data.

- to run backend server => yarn run dev
- to run frontend => yarn start
